-- 2014-12-29 UPDATE --

Updated to work with Boost 1.56+ (works with both 1.56 and 1.57 so far)

Automatically choose the currently selected SDK for both iOS and OSX

Fixed a couple places where the wrong $XXX_DEV_CMD was being used

-- END UPDATE --

This is a modified version of Pete Goodliffe's original boost.sh build script,
(and a couple of other sources whom I can't remember)

The original version didn't work with the 64-bit iPhone Simulator,
and didn't build at all for OSX.

This works for Boost 1.56 and 1.57. If you need the version that builds 1.55 and older, use this revision:
  https://gist.github.com/faithfracture/c629ae4c7168216a9856/61be257e1c0839c85743777d0687becad9913bf7

I also ran into an issue where utf8_codecvt_facet.o existed in both the 
program_options and filesystem libraries. When linking against the
framework, there was a missing vtable entry for it. Adding the step
in unpackArchive() that prepends the library name to the .o files
prevents this error.

I hope this keeps at least one other person from ripping their hair out.

Let me know if you find errors or have optimizations.

I will be updating this as often as necessary.
